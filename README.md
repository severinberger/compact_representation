This is the readme for the following code:

- LDS_somatosens_wm.ipynb

This code runs the optimization of the linear dynamical system for the somatosensory working memory task presented in Figure 5 of the main text. It also produces the model data depicted in Figure 5 and some other visualizations of the optimized linear dynamical system. The code is written as a Python Jupyter notebook that guides the user through all steps.

# Dependencies and system requirements:

The code has been tested with python version 3.6.10 and Jupyter notebook version 6.0.3.

Python libraries used:

- numpy 1.18.1
- mtaplotlib 3.1.1
- pytorch 1.3.1
